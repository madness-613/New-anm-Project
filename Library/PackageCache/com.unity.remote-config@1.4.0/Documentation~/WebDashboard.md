# Remote Config Dashboard
Though you must implement Unity Remote Config in your game code, you can update any [Environments](Environments.md) and [Rules and Settings](RulesAndSettings.md) stored by the service similarly as you would through the Editor Package UI, or [REST APIs](RESTAPI.md), using Unityâ€™s [Remote Config Dashboard](https://app.remote-config.unity3d.com/)
